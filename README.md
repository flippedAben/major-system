# major-system

A mnemonic system that helps me remember numbers by remembering images instead.
The mapping used is the following.
 * 0: s/z
 * 1: t/d
 * 2: n
 * 3: m
 * 4: r
 * 5: l
 * 6: g/j
 * 7: k/c
 * 8: f/v
 * 9: p/b
  
I want to remember the number, 753, the BCE date of the supposed founding of Rome by Romulus and Remus. I look at the major system mapping and get the list (k/c, l, m). With these letters, I need to make a word that gives me an image. This can be automated by searching through a regex dictionary, which I borrow from visca.com/regexdict. I insert 753 into the program, and the program returns a list of words.

Enter number: 753

calami

calm

celom

cilium

claim

clam

cleome

climax

clime

coelom

culm

kilim

I myself look through this list and select a word that is memorable. For me, it is a clam. So, I put that in a loci in my memory palace move on to the next number/fact/something.
